# *Garaje*

## tl;dr ... jk please read 
Garaje means garage in Spanish. It's a caf√© that meets an educational community space in Pasadena, TX. The concept involves a four-walled business powered by a dynamic education software platform. *Garaje* is an homage to intimate home garages that often produce and empower personal projects.

## the problem and the dream 
Pasadena is in the heart of a booming economy in the state of Texas. In the last decade, Pasadena has seen a decline in small businesses and a rise in corporate franchises providing all commerce. The community has drastically and rapidly changed in demographics, and the chambers of commerce have not been able to keep up with providing basic needs.

By building a physical space for people to consume locally sourced coffee and food, as well as access to a digital media platform that empowers entreprenuers' ideas, I believe we can spark sustainable growth in the city's economy. 

## the plan 
### *business solution*
*Garaje* will produce revenue via food and beverage sales, as well as educational courses and partnerships. With my family's Honduran and Colombian background, we can produce delicious small plates from a cuisine unique to the area. There is only one other independent coffee shop in Pasadena, so an additional option for residents will increase competition and healthy consumption.

### *software platform* 
*Garaje* is a community space for building. In addition to public computers, the cloud-based platform will offer: 
+ Web development courses
+ Podcast production courses
+ Creative writing courses
+ Public speaking courses
+ Musical composition courses
+ and more...

Founders and advisors of *Garaje* will produce the content, but it needs to live and be offered on an online platform. Additionally, guests of *Garaje* will be able to access the platform from their own home, but will only receive in-person instruction when they visit the coffee shop. 

## More on the software platform...
This is where I need the most help. I want Garaje's unique proposition to the community to be this learning platform. Additionally, I want to integrate with e-commerce solutions that provide selling and billing solutions to the coffee shop side of the business. I envision various user access rights for business owners and customers of the business.

Where I think I need to build on more next: 
+ Scope of the lessons
+ Access to computers onsite and how use will be managed
+ Costs of building the software platform, and where I could use existing software solutions
+ How to monetize the software platform

## Conclusion
The future of *Garaje* will be a convergence of software, community dialogue and delicious foods. Please let me know where I can expand on--I'm happy to discuss!
